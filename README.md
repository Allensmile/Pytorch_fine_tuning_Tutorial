# Pytorch_fine_tuning_Tutorial
This is a tutorial for performing fine tuning or transfer learning in PyTorch with your own data. It is based on a bunch of of official pytorch tutorials/examples. I felt that it was not exactly super trivial to perform in PyTorch, and so I thought I'd release my code as a tutorial which I wrote originally for my research. 

I'll try to explain any thing specific to Torch/PyTorch on the way so that people feel less confused!

Making these tutorials often takes a lot of time, if this helped you and you would like to help support me, feel free to make a donation to me on Bitcoin address (1GXYcL5XmCTMJBxK4zgdmXKh8PKcehzBVc), or my Ethereum address (0x31F62Fdf039BA956d75BFdB75cD3BbF66A6F82f2)

Hope this tutorial helps you out :)
