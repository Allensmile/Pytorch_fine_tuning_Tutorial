# Pytorch Tutorial for Fine Tuning/Transfer Learning

This is a tutorial for performing fine tuning or transfer learning in PyTorch with your own data. It is based on a bunch of of official pytorch tutorials/examples. I felt that it was not exactly super trivial to perform in PyTorch, and so I thought I'd release my code as a tutorial which I wrote originally for my research. 

All Torch and PyTorch specific details have been explained in detail in the file main_fine_tuning.py

Hope this tutorial helps you out :)
